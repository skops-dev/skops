    .. warning::

       This feature is very early in development, which means the API is

       caution as you would for ``pickle``: Don't load from sources that you
       don't trust. In the future, more security will be added.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: object
        The object to be saved. Usually a scikit-learn compatible model.

    file: str
        The file name. A zip archive will automatically created. As a matter of
        convention, we recommend to use the ".skops" file extension, e.g.
        ``save(model, "my-model.skops")``.
