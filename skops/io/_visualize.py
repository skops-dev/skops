    Shows the schema of a skops file as a tree view. In particular, highlights
    untrusted nodes. A node is considered untrusted if at least one of its child
    nodes is untrusted.

    Visualizing the tree using the default visualization function requires the
    ``rich`` library, which can be installed as:

        python -m pip install rich

    If passing a custom visualization function to ``sink``, ``rich`` is not
    required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file: str or pathlib.Path
        The file name of the object to be loaded.

    show: "all" or "untrusted" or "trusted"
        Whether to print all nodes, only untrusted nodes, or only trusted nodes.

    trusted: bool, or list of str, default=False
        If ``True``, all nodes will be treated as trusted. If ``False``, only
        default types are trusted. If a list of strings, where those strongs
        describe the trusted types, these types are trusted on top of the
        default trusted types.

    sink: function (default=:func:`~pretty_print_tree`)
        This function should take at least two arguments, an iterator of
        :class:`~NodeInfo` instances and an indicator of what to show. The
        ``NodeInfo`` contains the information about the node, namely:

            - the level of nesting (int)
            - the key of the node (str)
            - the value of the node as a string representation (str)
            - the safety of the node and its children

        The ``show`` argument is explained above. Any additional ``kwargs``
        passed to ``visualize`` will also be passed to ``sink``.

        The default sink is :func:`~pretty_print_tree`, which takes these
        additional parameters:

            - tag_safe: The tag used to mark trusted nodes (default="", i.e no
              tag)
            - tag_unsafe: The tag used to mark untrusted nodes
              (default="[UNSAFE]")
            - use_colors: Whether to colorize the nodes (default=True). Colors
              requires the ``rich`` package to be installed.
            - color_safe: Color to use for trusted nodes (default="green")
            - color_unsafe: Color to use for untrusted nodes (default="red")
            - color_child_unsafe: Color to use for nodes that are trusted but
              that have untrusted child ndoes (default="yellow")

        So if you don't want to have colored output, just pass
        ``use_colors=False`` to ``visualize``. The colors themselves, such
        as "red" and "green", refer to the standard colors used by ``rich``.
