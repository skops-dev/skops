class Node:
    """A node in the tree of objects.

    This class is a parent class for all nodes in the tree of objects. Each
    type of object (e.g. dict, list, etc.) has its own subclass of Node.

    Each child class has to implement two methods: ``__init__`` and
    ``_construct``.

    ``__init__`` takes care of traversing the state tree and to create the
    corresponding ``Node`` objects. It has access to the ``load_context`` which
    in turn has access to the source zip file. The child class's ``__init__``
    must load attributes into the ``children`` attribute, which is a
    dictionary of ``{child_name: unloaded_value/Node/list/etc}``. The
    ``get_unsafe_set`` should be able to parse and validate the values set
    under the ``children`` attribute. Note that primitives are persisted as a
    ``JsonNode``.

    ``_construct`` takes care of constructing the object. It is only called
    once and the result is cached in ``construct`` which is implemented in this
    class. All required data to construct an instance should be loaded during
    ``__init__``.

    The separation of ``__init__`` and ``_construct`` is necessary because
    audit methods are called after ``__init__`` and before ``construct``.
    Therefore ``__init__`` should avoid creating any instances or importing
    any modules, to avoid running potentially untrusted code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state : dict
        A dict representing the state of the dumped object.

    load_context : LoadContext
        The context of the loading process.

    trusted : bool or list of str, default=False
        If ``True``, the object will be loaded without any security checks. If
        ``False``, the object will be loaded only if there are only trusted
        objects in the dumped file. If a list of strings, the object will be
        loaded only if all of its required types are listed in ``trusted``
        or are trusted by default.

    memoize : bool, default=True
        If ``True``, the object will be memoized in the load context, if it has
        the ``__id__`` set. This is used to avoid loading the same object
        multiple times.
