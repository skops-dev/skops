Review Process
--------------

Don't hesitate to ping @skops-dev/mintainers in your issues and pull requests
if you don't receive a review in a timely manner. We try to review all pull
requests as soon as we can.

If you have permissions, you should almost never merge your own pull request
unless it's a hotfix and needs to be merged really quick and it's not a major
change.

Otherwise pull requests can be merged if at least one other person has approved
it on GitHub. Please don't merge them until all outstanding comments are
addressed or the discussions are concluded and people have agreed to tackle
them in future pull requests.

If you intend to work on an issue, leave a comment and state your intentions.
Also feel free to ask for clarifications if you're not sure what the issue
entails. If you don't understand an issue, it's on us, not on you!
