Welcome to skops's documentation!
=================================

``skops`` is a Python library helping you share you `scikit-learn
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__ based models and put them in production.

The library is still a work in progress and under active development.

The following examples are good starting points:

- How to create and initialize a scikit-learn model repo:
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_hf_hub.py`
- How to create a model card for your scikit-learn based model:
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_model_card.py`

In order to better understand the role of each file and their content when
uploaded to HuggingFace Hub, refer to this :ref:`user guide <hf_hub>`.
