Model Cards for scikit-learn
============================

This library allows you to automatically create model cards for your models,
which are a short documentation explaining what the model does, how it's
trained, and its limitations. `Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/>`__
expects a ``README.md`` file containing a certain set of metadata at the
beginning of it, following with the content of the model card in markdown
format. The metadata section is used to make models searchable on the Hub, and
get the inference API and the widgets on the website working.

The metadata part of the file needs to follow the specifications `here
<https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-cards#model-card-metadata>`__. It
includes simple attributes of your models such as the task you're solving,
dataset you trained the model with, evaluation results and more. When the model
is hosted on the Hub, information in metadata like task name or dataset help
your model be discovered on the `Hugging Face Hub
<https://huggingface.co/models>`__. The task identifiers should follow the task
taxonomy defined in Hugging Face Hub, as it enables the inference widget on the
model page. An example to task identifier can be ``"tabular-classification"``
or ``"text-regression"``.

Here's an example of the metadata section of the ``README.md`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    library_name: sklearn
    tags:
    - tabular-classification
    license: mit
    datasets:
    - breast-cancer
    metrics:
    - accuracy
    ---

``skops`` creates this section of the file for you, and you almost never need
to touch it yourself.

The markdown part does not necessarily need to follow any specification in
terms of information passed, which gives the user a lot of flexibility. The
markdown part of the ``README.md`` file is generated from a Jinja template
with slots that you can inject your content in. ``skops`` has a default
template which includes the following slots for free text sections:

- ``"model_description"``: A description of the model.
- ``"limitations"``: Intended use for the model, limitations and potential
  biases. This section should also include risks of using models in certain
  domains if relevant.
- ``"get_started_code"``: Code the user can run to load and use the model.
- ``"model_card_authors"``: Authors of the model card. This section includes
  authors of the model card, while ``citation_bibtex`` includes citations
  related to the model if relevant.
- ``"model_card_contact"``: Contact information of people whom can be reached
  out, in case of questions about the model or the model card.
- ``"citation_bibtex"``: Bibtex style citations for the model or resources used
  to train the model.

The template also contains the following sections that are automatically
generated by ``skops``.

- ``"hyperparameter_table"``: Hyperparameters of the model.
- ``"model_plot"``: A diagram of the model, most relevant in case the model is
  a complex scikit-learn :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.

You can also add other sections to the model  card by passing arbitrary
keywords to :meth:`.Card.add`.
