Model Cards for scikit-learn
============================

This library allows you to automatically create documentation for models, also
known as model cards. The specifications of the model cards and tools to create
them depend on the format `Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/>`__ expects
them to comply with. This format consist of two parts, a metadata part for model
discoverability and markdown part for information related to model. Hub expects
the card to be a markdown file called ``README.md``.

The metadata part of the file needs to follow the notation `here
<https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-cards#model-card-metadata>`__. It
includes simple attributes of your models such as the task you're solving,
dataset you trained the model with, evaluation results and more. When the model
is hosted on the Hub, information in metadata like task name or dataset help
your model be discovered at the `Hugging Face Hub
<https://huggingface.co/models>`__. The task identifiers should follow the task
taxonomy defined in Hugging Face Hub, as it enables the inference widget on the
model page. An example to task identifier can be ``"tabular-classification"`` or
``"text-regression"``.

An example metadata part looks like below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    library_name: sklearn
    tags:
    - tabular-classification
    license: mit
    datasets:
    - breast-cancer
    metrics:
    - accuracy
    ---

The markdown part does not necessarily need to follow any specification by means of
information passed, which gives the user a lot of flexibility. The markdown part
of the card is generated from templates with slots that you can inject your
content in. ``skops`` has a default template called ``default_template.md``.

``default_template.md`` includes the following for free text sections:

- model_description: Simple description of the model,
- limitations: Intended use for the model, limitations and biases,
- get_started_code: Code the user can run to load and use the model,
- model_card_authors: Authors of the model card,
- model_card_contact: Contact information to reach out to the model card authors,
- citation_bibtex: Citation for the resources used to train the model.

The template also contains following sections that are automatically generated by ``skops``.

- hyperparameter_table: Hyperparameters of the model.
- model_plot: Plot of the model.

If you want a custom template, you can pass the ``template_path`` with :meth:`.Card.add`.
