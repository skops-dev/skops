v0.1
----

This is the first release of the library. It include two main modules:

- :mod:`skops.hub_utils`: tools to create a model repository to be stored on
  `Hugging Face Hub <https://hf.co/models>`__, mainly through
  :func:`skops.hub_utils.init` and :func:`skops.hub_utils.push`.
- :mod:`skops.card`: tools to create a model card explaining what the model does
  and how it should be used. The model card can then be stored as the
  ``README.md`` file on the Hugging Face Hub, with pre-populated metadata to
  help Hub understand the model.
