Examples of interactions with the Hugging Face Hub
==================================================

- Creating the Model Card:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_model_card.py` is an example of using
    skops to create a model card that can be used on the Hugging Face Hub.
- Tabular Regression:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_tabular_regression.py` is an example of using skops to serialize a tabular
    regression model and create a model card and a Hugging Face Hub repository.
- Text Classification:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_text_classification.py` is an example of using skops to serialize a text
    classification model and create a model card and a Hugging Face Hub repository.
- Long semi-realistic guide using the California Housing dataset:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_california_housing.py` is an exercise that
    goes through a semi-realistic data science and machine learning task and
    develops a practical solution for it. It uses skops for model saving, model
    card generation, and upload to the Hugging Face Hub.
