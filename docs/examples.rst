Examples of interactions with the Hugging Face Hub
==================================================

- Creating the Model Card:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_model_card.py` is an example of using 
    skops to create a model card that can be used on the Hugging Face Hub.
- Putting the Model Card on the Hub:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_hf_hub.py` is an example of using skops 
    to put a model card on the Hugging Face Hub.
- Tabular Regression:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_tabular_regression.py` is an example of using skops to serialize a tabular 
    regression model and create a model card and a Hugging Face Hub repository.
- Text Classification:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_text_classification.py` is an example of using skops to serialize a text 
    classification model and create a model card and a Hugging Face Hub repository.
- Using Intel(R) Extension for scikit-learn:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_intelex.py` is an example of using
    Intel(R) Extension for scikit-learn to speed up inference of classical
    machine learning algorithms and how performance-optimized models work with
    Hugging Face Hub.
